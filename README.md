- Track 2 (1.5hrs) - Game Development
  - Kaboom JS
    - Show example project
    - Show how project is made with the premade functions
    - Show a bit of the Kaboom/JavaScript code under-the-hood
  - Build a game
    - Build a simple game with the premade functions
- End of day
  - Poll students to see which track they'd like to pursue for the rest of the camp

### Day 2

- How to plan presentation (20min)

      - Build one function and test
- Planning workshop (this will happen within their chosen track) (30min)
  - Teachers will allow students to plan on their own, but will provide help and feedback as needed
- Building time (Rest of time)
  - Teachers will allow students to build and test on their own, but will need to be very proactive to make sure students know how to proceed and are not struggling.

### Day 3

- No content. Just give students time to build.

### Day 4

- Final touches (1.5hrs)
  - No content. Just give students some time to put final touches on their projects
- Gaming Project presentation booths (1hr)
  - Each student gets a table where they can present their project to the rest of the students
  - This is also a time to invite local professionals to come and see what projects the students were able to build
- Robot wars (30min)
  - Now the robotics students will set their robots against each other in the final robot war challenge
